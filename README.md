Introduction

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should:

    Implement the new webpage,
    Keep the old webpage, or
    Perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
